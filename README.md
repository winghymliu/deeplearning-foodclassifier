### Deep Learning Image Classifier for Food

Currently there are over 170,000,000 food photos on social media sites but searching and discovering data is still a manual process via tags. The aim of the project is to investigate image classification using convolutional neural networks as a means to automatically tag food within images.

### Setup 

## Hardware Requirements

The experiments ran on AWS with the following specifications:

Deep Learning AMI with Conda (Ubuntu) (ami-1812bb61)
p2.xlarge (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/) 
1 GPU, i7 4 Cores, 61 GB RAM
